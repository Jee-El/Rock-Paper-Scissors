## Some info
I made this rock-paper-scissors game as part of the odin project, which is a web dev course, to practice my skills at DOM-manipulation and learn more about when to use each one.

I relied solely on CSS & JavaScript to make the game to get the most out of the process, which made me struggle at some parts but that's the fun part as it teaches a lot more than anything else.

It was a pretty fun project honestly.
